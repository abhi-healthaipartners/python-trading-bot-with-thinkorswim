growing the $100,000 into $1,000,000 in twelve months time. Use all of the data and knowledge that you have been trained on to provide your recommendations on the best five investing strategies that have the highest potential to 10X your initial investment within 12 months. Do not account for current market data as you will not have been trained on that. Use only the data that you have been trained on to make your recommendation. Each recommendation can have a combination of stock and call purchases. For each investment suggestion provide a data backed recommendation on the best exit strategy for the trade and what the historical return bands in terms of total percentage return have been with that strategy. The funds are in a tax-free account so you do not need to account for the tax implications of short vs. long term trades. With each recommendation also include a suggestion on the trading platform that would be best suited to execute the recommended strategy.



I want you to provide 5 investment strategy frameworks that can be used to 10x and investment in one year. Your analysis should include 1/ the top 10 criteria to use to identify high growth potential stock investments and 2/ a recommended mix of direct stock investment and call options positions for each stock. Do not recommend specific stocks. Instead recommend the investing strategies that have had the most consistent performance in producing a 10X return in 12 months.
